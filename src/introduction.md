# Introduction

Welcome to my personal JavaScript toolbox!  

This was created as a school project for the modul [WebPr](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/studium/module/9568617?show_language=en). Here, everything that happened is documented and (hopefully) sufficiently explain so that it can be understand and replicated. Keep in mind that this is written from the perspective of somebody who is already familiar with programming, so many basic concepts won't be explained anymore.

Start [here](./1_functions.md) with chapter one!
